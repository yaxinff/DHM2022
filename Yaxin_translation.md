那个时候是我妈妈要我嫁过来，她是在马来西亚给一个中国老板看老人家的，在那边呆了五年，然后一回来就把我嫁到中国来。他们都说中国人好，不会喝酒，不会打（人），赚来的钱都给老婆花；像我们柬埔寨（人），就是喜欢喝酒，喝醉了会打的。我当时觉得，我不认识他，他不认识我，怎么嫁过来。我就是怕，怕别人对我不好，万一对我不好的话，怎么回去也不知道，就是怕。（介绍人）说，你别管这个问题，只要同意嫁过来就好了。我是有点想不同意，但是我妈妈想我嫁人，因为我都20岁了。那时候我说不想来，介绍人说不来就要赔他3000美金，那我没钱赔的。我嫁过来，他就给我妈妈500美金。

没几天了，护照都办好要上飞机了，介绍人拿了一个照片给我，就是我老公，上面写我老公的工作是什么，几岁，有几个兄弟，这些。他们都安排好了，怕也要去。那天，全家坐三轮车送我去金边。我第一次坐飞机，心里有点高兴的，可是我坐下来没有人和我说话，又有一点怕的。我想，中国离家那么远，要嫁给一个我不认识的人，我又不会说中国话，怎么办？他会不会对我不好？他打我的话，我是一定要回家的。可是我怎么回去呢？会不会嫁在中国回不来了？越想越怕，我就睡着了，睡醒就到中国。所有人都讲我听不懂的话。我心里是很怕的，就一直看窗户外面的水泥公路，又想我家不知道怎么样，好不好啊。

（告知采访结束之后，阿梅请我喝旺仔牛奶，我们坐着闲聊。她很是拘谨地笑一笑，撇了一眼空荡荡的门口，然后讲了一个故事：）

刚刚来的时候，我有跑过的。他们（婆婆）说，你现在不和他睡，迟早也是要和他睡觉的，我想就算了，反正都是要的，睡就睡了。一个月后我就怀孕了。我老公出去上班的，我一个人在家里，很害怕，想很多坏的事情。后来有几个我们老乡找我，说中国人不好，会打人会骂人，钱也不给老婆用。我老公是没打我没骂人，但是我跟他就是他吃他的，我吃我的，跟他没有感情一样，因为我一点都不会讲中文。我想在这边怎么生活，以前都不认识，又没有谈过恋爱。突然一下子就有小孩了，我不知道怎么办。不会说（中文）真的是很麻烦，我怎么办，就想回去。算了算了，别想那么多，要回去就回去嘛。我们六个人，打电话给上海大使馆有一个我们老乡，骗他说老公打我们，说我们想回家。我们每个人都想好了，就是骗他嘛，说家里对我不好，打我骂我，锁在房间里不给我出门，怎么说能让他相信你，就是这样想好的。我们借他的电话打电话给家里，我打给我外婆说家里对我不好想回家，我妈妈就给我打了500美金买机票。

## Translation

It was my mother that wanted me to marry to China at that time. She had worked in a Malaysian Chinese family as an elderly caregiver for 5 years. As soon as she returned, she married me off to China. People said that Chinese man are ideal husbands, they don’t drink or hit wives, and they give all salary to their wives. In Cambodia, man can get violent when they are drunk. I thought, I don’t know him and he doesn’t know me, how can I marry him and move to China? I was so afraid, afraid that he treated me badly and if so, I have no idea how to go home. The matchmaker said, “don’t worry about it, just you agree to marry”. I had some doubts and didn't want to agree, but my mother wanted me to get married because I was already 20 years old. I said I didn't want to come, and the matchmaker said if I didn't come, I would have to pay him $3,000. I didn't have the money to pay. Then I got married and he gave my mother $500.

There were only a few days left, and my passport was ready. I was about to board the plane. The matchmaker gave me a photo of my husband with his personal information, like his job, age, siblings, etc. Everything was arranged, and I had no choice but to go. That day, the whole family rode a tricycle to send me to Phnom Penh. It was my first time on the airplane, and I felt a bit happy but when I sat down, no one talked to me, and I became a bit scared. I thought, China is so far from home, and I must marry someone I don't know, and I don't even speak Chinese. How can I deal with it? Will he treat me badly? If he batters me, I will definitely go home, but how can I go back? Will I be trapped in China after getting married? The more I thought about it, the more afraid I became, then I just fell asleep. When I woke up, I was already in China. Everyone was speaking a strange language that I couldn't understand. I was very sacred, so I kept looking at the concrete road outside the window and wondered about my family’s situation.

*After the interview, Amei offered me a bottle of milk and we sat and chatted. She smiled timidly, glanced at the empty entrance, and then told a story*.
	
In the first few months after I arrived, I ran away once. They (mother-in-law) told me that even if I don’t sleep with him today, sooner or later, I will have to sleep with him anyway. Let it be, we will do that thing someday, whatever. After a month, I got pregnant. My husband went out to work, and I was alone at home, very scared and thinking about many bad things. Later, a few of my fellow Cambodian approached me, saying that Chinese man are not kind, they hit and curse at us, and they don't give money to wives. My husband didn't hit me or curse at me, but our relationship was like he had his own life, and I had mine. We had no emotional connection because I couldn't speak Chinese at all. I wondered how I would manage to live here since I didn't know him and had never been in a romantic relationship before. Suddenly, I had a child, and I didn't know what to do. It was really troublesome not being able to speak (Chinese), so I thought about going home. Well, forget it, don't think too much, just go home. The six of us called a Cambodian worked in the Shanghai consulate, lied and told him that our husbands were battering us, and we wanted to return home. We borrowed his phone and called our families. Each of us had prepared what to say to make him believe us, like battering me and locking me in the room. I called my grandmother and told her my situation, then my mother sent me $500 to buy a plane ticket.
